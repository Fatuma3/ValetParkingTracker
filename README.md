# Valet Parking Tracker

## Introduction

Valet Parking Tracker is an application used by valet managers and valet attendants to enable the tracking of vehicles parked in a valet garage. Valet attendants can check in a vehicle any time with information such as ticket number, vehicle make, model, color, parking spot, and special information.  
The valet manager can generate reports showing detailed info of every vehicle in their garage at any given time.  
Users can interact with Valet Parking Tracker using RESTful service endpoints, through a UI, or both.
